      <img src="assets/images/me.jpg" class="auth-image">

      <h1>  I am no special one, just a computer guy. But this insanely talented dude has a hard background in computers, When I started as a developer couple year ago the I got my System Analyst Bachelor degree. I realize that computers would help us do things has never imagine as a simple human. Now, here i am looking to get those dreams thru the right path using my ackowledge and experience in develope tools to archive goals that I was dreaming with for a while.</h1>

      <h1> I am always trying to come up with new ideas and tools to make people computer experince easy and more  productive, helping bussines to archieve their goals and help myself to gain more experience, and be able to apply them on my daily basic activities, not an easy job , but no impossible either. </h1>

      <h1> I am inspired by my Family (Specialy my mother, douthers and soon) that I belive makes people able to go over dificulties and face day to day activities. Specialy now in front of computers or in front of devices that interact with the web world, why no help their life be less difficult when they are in front of a Web Interface or Application that they need to deal with everyday, many times a day.</h1>

      <h1> Well, Here I am building this dream real....to be continued...</h1>
